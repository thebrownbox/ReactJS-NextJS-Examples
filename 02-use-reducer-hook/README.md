# useReducer Hook

## When do we use useReducer hook?

-   useReducer have the same feature with useState, so why we need useReducer? and when we should use useReducer instead of useState.

1. useState when the data is simple.
2. useState when the data is NOT depend on each others.
3. So if the data is complex and also they depend on each others => we should use useReducer.
